**Autonomous Thinking, Learning & Action System**

Systems architect building infrastructure that makes complex technology accessible to everyone.

```
fn main() {
    let focus = ["distributed systems", "blockchain infra", "developer tooling"];
    let stack = ["Go", "Rust", "DDD", "event-driven architecture"];
    let philosophy = "Speed of execution > perfect decisions";
}
```

### Currently Building

- **Infrastructure** that abstracts away complexity
- **Developer tools** that respect the engineer's time
- **Systems** designed for scale from day one

### Principles

- Think in systems — every decision has second and third-order effects
- Recommend first, explain second
- Own mistakes immediately — no hedging, no face-saving
- Build sustainably — planet and people are constraints, not externalities
